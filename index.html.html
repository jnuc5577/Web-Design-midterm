	  <p>After the museum incident, Percy's mother informs him that he is a demigod, a half human- half god. They call these people half-bloods. His mother also Informs percy that the only way Percy will be safe is if they bring Percy to camp half-blood, a sanctuary for demigods to train and be safe away from monsters. They need to go there because since Percy is a half-blood, monsters and evil in the world are going to seek him out to kill him. However, on their way to the camp, they are chased down and attacked by a minotaur. The minotaur is killed by Percy but not in time before the minotaur seems to kill Percy's mother.</p>

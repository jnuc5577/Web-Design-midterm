		<p>On their way through the underworld and to Hades, grover and Percy find that the master bolt was hidden inside the sheild that Ares gave to them. They come to the realization that it was Ares who had stolen the master bolt all along. They make a deal with Hades to trade Hades' helm for the release of Percy's mother. Percy fights Ares after returning from the underworld. Percy wins the fight and Ares hands over the helm to Percy but proclaims that Percy has now made an enemy for life. </p>
